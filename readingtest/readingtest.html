    My father’s family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name Philip, my
    infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit than
    Pip. So, I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip. I give Pirrip as my
    father’s family name, on the authority of his tombstone and my sister,—Mrs.
    Joe Gargery, who married the blacksmith. As I never saw my father or my
    mother, and never saw any likeness of either of them (for their days were
    long before the days of photographs), my first fancies regarding what they
    were like were unreasonably derived from their tombstones. The shape of the
    letters on my father’s, gave me an odd idea that he was a square, stout,
    dark man, with curly black hair. From the character and turn of the
    inscription, “Also Georgiana Wife of the Above,” I drew a childish
    conclusion that my mother was freckled and sickly. To five little stone
    lozenges, each about a foot and a half long, which were arranged in a neat
    row beside their grave, and were sacred to the memory of five little
    brothers of mine,—who gave up trying to get a living, exceedingly early in
    that universal struggle,—I am indebted for a belief I religiously
    entertained that they had all been born on their backs with their hands in
    their trousers-pockets, and had never taken them out in this state of
    existence. Ours was the marsh country, down by the river, within, as the
    river wound, twenty miles of the sea. My first most vivid and broad
    impression of the identity of things seems to me to have been gained on a
    memorable raw afternoon towards evening. At such a time I found out for
    certain that this bleak place overgrown with nettles was the churchyard; and
    that Philip Pirrip, late of this parish, and also Georgiana wife of the
    above, were dead and buried; and that Alexander, Bartholomew, Abraham,
    Tobias, and Roger, infant children of the aforesaid, were also dead and
    buried; and that the dark flat wilderness beyond the churchyard, intersected
    with dikes and mounds and gates, with scattered cattle feeding on it, was
    the marshes; and that the low leaden line beyond was the river; and that the
    distant savage lair from which the wind was rushing was the sea; and that
    the small bundle of shivers growing afraid of it all and beginning to cry,
    was Pip.
